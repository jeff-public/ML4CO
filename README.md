ML for CO

#### For myself
1. In the Phase I ttraining, use "pos_weight: since there tends to be more 0 than 1
2. In the Phase II training, use custom weight, but one weight for the whole prediction, or individual weight for each element in the prediction (The second case need assumption of independence, may not hold?).
